## Coding Standard Documentations

### [Concrete5 Developers Documentation](https://documentation.concrete5.org/developers)
A practical guide on creating websites from beginning to end with concrete5.


### [Concrete5 CheatSheet](https://github.com/shahroq/whale_c5_cheat_sheet)
This is a collection of concrete5 cheat sheets, based on the C5 V8+ source code.


### [Concrete5 CheatSheet (webli)](https://www.webli.us/cheatsheet/doku.php)
It's another cheatsheet with nice representation you may want to follow.


### [PHP Standards Recommendations](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)
concrete5 follows the PHP Framework Interoperability Group's PSR guidelines for code style.
For version 7 and version 8 follow [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) For version 9 and above follow [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) [PSR-12](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)


### [PHP The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/)
PHP: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP popular coding standards, links to authoritative tutorials around the Web and what the contributors consider to be best practices at the present time.

IMO, reading this documentation is enough to be a good `PHP` programmer. Strongly recommended following.

## Official Documentations (libraries)

### [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/)
The Carbon is a useful helper class which is inherited from the PHP DateTime class.


### [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/)
The Doctrine Project is the home to several PHP libraries primarily focused on database storage and object mapping. The core projects are the [Object Relational Mapper (ORM)](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html) and the [Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL)](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html) it is built upon.


### [Stash](https://www.stashphp.com/index.html)
Stash makes it easy to speed up your code by caching the results of expensive functions or code. Certain actions, like database queries or calls to external APIs, take a lot of time to run but tend to have the same results over short periods of time. This makes it much more efficient to store the results and call them back up later.
