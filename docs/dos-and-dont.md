# Dos and Don't

## Code Refactoring
### DO:
- Keep things separate. i.e., refactoring, fix, feature, functionality improvements should be in separate pull requests.

### DON'T:
- Don't do breaking changes without confirmation.


## Pull Request
### DO:
- Make sure you've checked your codes and tested the functionalities before making a pull request.
- Write down the changes summary, and the steps to test in the PR description.
- When your reviewer suggests a fix or example code don't rely on it. You should write the actual code from that idea. Also don't hesitate to share if you have any better solution/idea.
